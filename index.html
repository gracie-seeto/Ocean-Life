        It's the feeling few of recognise as we dive into the salty warm water. Most thoughs are; let's stay here and never leave. Let's move to the beach and live life. It tends to be a fleeting thought that dissipates as we throw ourselves back into a day to day routine. 
            For some however, the cry of the ocean lingers, niggling away at the bak of them mind, until one day they pack their bags and never look back</p>
